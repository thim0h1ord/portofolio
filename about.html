<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
    I am Timothy by Name. I took interest in Web development knowing fully I love being creative. <br />
    My tech journey started early this year, 2023 when I had to go into what I like doing well, although <br />
    it hasn`t been so easy and I have already made up my mind never to give up, remaiming focus and breaking hurdles is the goal.
</p>

<p>I am always open to meeting people to share ideas, come up with new innovations and impacting knowledge. <br />
    Seeing to the achievement a project and making the world a better place where people can easily get access <br /> 
    to their needs at the comfort of their home. </p>
